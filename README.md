## Get Started

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to get this project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Building the Docker Environment

Build and start the containers:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Installing Dependencies

```
docker-compose exec app sh
composer install
```

### Database Setup

Set up the database:

```
bin/cake migrations migrate
```

### Accessing the Application

The application should now be accessible at http://localhost:34251

## How to check

### Authentication
I created 2 accounts with the following information (Please run the migration again if you have run it before):
```
User1
email: pham.bqt@gmail.com
pass: P@ss1234tai

User2
email: pham.bqt2@gmail.com
pass: P@ss1234tai2
```

#### To get access token (login):
* About the Authentication feature, I use the [cakephp/authentication plugin](https://book.cakephp.org/authentication/2/en/index.html).
* About the Authorization feature, I use the [cakephp/authorization plugin](https://book.cakephp.org/authorization/2/en/index.html).

* Request:
```

{
    "email": "pham.bqt@gmail.com",
    "password": "P@ss1234tai"
}
```
* Response:<br>

**- In case of successful login.**

```
HTTP Status Code: 200
```
```
{
  "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJteWFwcCIsInN1YiI6MSwiZXhwIjoxNzEwOTI2NjQ3fQ.Hw12qMLfvEf51wVgEVT1OupSgRRgLyrAUxJugcY36_yMST6NpoNfZ7N0-b7DYYPbaCWQ5evqJf0_ZB6abREgJ0dFYfGano3e7kikIOUB_90sIeo7LBlBJCXvVGLZdtDFw_Qxs_Qqd0rtXiDM3NQ04uFiovVkKZz0DxYVe6y2fA8"
}
```

**- In case of unsuccessful login.**
```
HTTP Status Code: 401
```
```
{
    "message": "The Username or Password is Incorrect"
}
```

The received access token will be used to authenticate requests that require authentication. 
Access token is generated by JWT(JSON Web Tokens). You can get more details at https://jwt.io/.
